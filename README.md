# AFS code for cleaning and analyzing fish data 

The data cleaning script provides examples of cleaning the raw data went through before analysis. Common cleaning functions include joining individual state and province data together, cleaning column names, removing columns, cleaning data names, joining old and new data, creating new sample ID and summing effort by new sample ID, assigning season to method and filtering out non-standard data (ex. fall boat electrofishing), grouping trout species by lentic and lotic, removing outliers from length, weight, and effort data, adding count data per data set, and adding Gabelhouse categories for PSD calculations using the FSA package.
